One of the things that the Hindus do in relationship to Kali, is offer sacrifices. So you can say, well "Why would you offer sacrifices to something you're afraid of?". And it's because that is what you do, that's always what you do. 

You offer up sacrifices to the unknown in the hope that good things will happen to you.

One example is that you're worried about your future. Maybe you're worried about your job, or who you're going to marry, or your family, there's a whole category of things to be worried about, so you're worried about your future. SO what're you doing in university? And the answer is you're sacrificing your free time in the present, to the cosmos so to speak, in the hope that if you offer up that sacrifice properly, the future will smile upon you. And that's one of the fundamental discoveries of the human race. And it's a big deal, that discovery: by changing what you cling to in the present, you can alter the future.
