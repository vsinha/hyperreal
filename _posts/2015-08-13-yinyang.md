The Taoists believe the Yin Yang symbol represents Being. Now Being is not the same thing as reality, Being is what you experience is a conscious creature. For the Taoist, being is made up of Order and Chaos. And the reason for that is quite straightforward, the reason for that is wherever you go, whoever you are, each environment that you're in is composed of things you understand and things that work the way you expect them to, and things that you do not understand and that can pull the rug out from under you at any moment. 

And so you can say in some sense that these symbolic representations are representations of the most unchanging elements of Being. So the most real things. Because well, the typical modern person would look at this and think 'those aren't real'. They are real. In fact they are **hyperreal**, because one of the things that defines real is that it's permanent. And it *is* permanent, no matter where you go there are things you know and things you don't know, and it doesn't matter who you are, it's permanent. It's part of the existential landscape of human Being.
