What's a mistake but a kind of take? <br>
What's nausea but a kind of -ausea? <br>
Sober, drunk, *-unk*, astonishment. <br>
Everything can become the subject of criticism -- how criticise without something *to* criticise? <br>
Agreement -- disagreement!! <br>
Emotion -- motion!!! <br>
Die away from, *from*, die away (without the *from*j). <br>
Reconciliation of opposites; sober, drunk, all the same! <br>
Good and evil reconciled in a laugh! <br>

No verbiage can give it, because the verbiage is *other*. <br>
*In*coherent, coherent -- same. <br>
And it fades! And it's infinite! AND it's infinite! <br>
If it wasn't *going*, why should you hold on to it? <br>

Something, and *other* than that thing! <br>
Intoxication, and *otherness* than intoxication. <br>

--is a ----. <br>
It fades forever and forever as we move.

There *is* a reconciliation! <br>
Reconciliation -- *e*conciliation! <br>
By God, how that hurts! By God, how it *doesn*'t hurt! <br>
Reconciliation of two extremes. <br>
By George, nothing but *oth*ing! <br>
That sounds like nonsense, but it is pure onsense! <br>
Thought deeper than speech ----! <br>
Medical school; divinity school, *school!*, SCHOOL! Oh my God, oh God, oh God!. <br>

The most coherent and articulate sentence which came was this: -- <br>
**There are no differences but differences of degree between different degrees of difference and no difference.**
