title: Intelligence Goes Wrong
permalink: /intelligence/

Intelligence is something that can go very wrong, if it goes wrong. One of it's big temptations is that it produces models of the world, and then falls in love with the models. And when it falls in love with the models that makes it totalitarian, because it believes that its constructions are good enough so that there doesn't need to be anything else. It eliminates the necessity of the transcendent. And that's definitely a characteristic of any totalitarian system. It says: this is everything we need. And then, you know, if you happen to suffer, or if you happen to openly rebel against this system then you're regarded as an enemy of truth. And then it's fine to do with you whatever might be done, because everything that's worth doing is already being done.
