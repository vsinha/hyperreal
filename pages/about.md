I am not Jordan B. Peterson, but I am a huge fan.

In watching his Personality and its Transformations lectures [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/JordanPetersonVideos), I took notes.

This is the result of those notes.

>Note: I, Viraj Sinha, do not claim that any of these quotes are my original content, because they're not. They're JBP's original content. I copied down some publically available lectures, and put them on the internet. Because that's just what millenails are prone to doing. We put stuff on the internet.

I do accept pull requests, go watch some lectures and write some notes and contribute.
